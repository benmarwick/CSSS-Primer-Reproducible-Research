Definitions
========================================================

*Replicable* refers to the ability to run a code and produce
exactly the same results as published 

*Reproducible* refers to the ability to create a code that
independently verifies the published results using
the information provided

>"the goal of reproducible research is to tie specific instructions to data analysis and experimental data so that scholarship can be recreated, better understood and verified." <small>- Max Kuhn, CRAN Task View: Reproducible Research</small>

Motivations
========================================================

>"An article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result." <small>- Claerbout and Karrenbach, Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics. 1992</small>

>"When we publish articles containing figures which were generated by computer, we also publish the complete software environment which generates the figures" <small>- Buckheit & Donoho, Wavelab and Reproducible Research, 1995.</small>


Benefits
=======================================================
- Verification & Reliability: Easier to find and fix bugs. The results you produce today will be the same results you will produce tomorrow.
- Transparency: Leads increased citation count, broader impact, improved institutional memory
- Efficiency: Reuse allows for de-duplication of effort. Payoff in the (not so) long run
- Flexibility: When you dont 'point-and-click' you gain many new analytic options.

Restrictions
=======================================================
- Classified or sensitive data
- Nondisclosure agreements
- Intellectual property & software licensing issues
- Inertia & embarassment 

Spectrum of reproducibility

Common practice in social sciences
========================================================
- Enter data in Excel
- Use Excel for data cleaning, etc
- Generate descriptive statistics in Excel
- Import data into SPSS/SAS/Stata for further analysis
- Use point-and-click options to run statistical analyses
- Copy & paste output to Word document, repeatedly 

***

- Missing data are handled inconsistently and sometimes incorrectly 
- Excel uses poor algorithms for many functions
- Scripting is possible but rare 

Click trails are ephemeral 
========================================================
- GUIs and copy-paste are bad for reproducibility 
- A lot of manual & ad hoc data handling - error prone
- Leaves no trace - no audit trail
- Difficult to document
- Difficult to remember

Reinhart and Rogoff controversy
========================================================
- Claimed that higher debt-to-G.D.P. ratios are associated with lower levels of G.D.P. growth
- Identified the threshold to -ve growth at a debt-to-G.D.P. ratio of >90%
- Substantial impact on autsterity politics 
- Reanalysis identified no threshold and +2.2% at >90%

Scripted analyses endure
========================================================

***

- Allow for automation and communication of process
- Plain text files and UTF-8 encoding will be readable for a long time
- They are much more accessible

Literate statistical programming 
========================================================
>"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do."-- Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984

***

For example...
Let's calculate the current time in R.

```r
time <- format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

The text and R code are interwoven in the output:

The time is `` `r time` ``

The time is Sun Feb 16 2:40:49 AM 2014

Advantages and disadvantages
========================================================
Advantages of switching to literate programming
- Text and code all in one place, in logical order
- Data, results automatically updated to reflect external changes
- Automatic test when building document

Some disadvantages
- Text and code all in one place; can be hard to read sometimes, especially if there is a lot of code
- Can substantially slow down the processing of documents
(although caching can help)

Need a programming language
========================================================
Machine-readable

R: Free, open source, cross-platform, highly interactive, huge user community in academica and private sector

R packages: the ideal 'Compendium'?

>both a container for the different elements that make up the document and its computations (i.e. text, code, data, etc.), and as a means for distributing, managing and updating the collection... allow us to move from an era of advertisement to one where our scholarship itself is published <small>- Gentleman and Temple Lang 2004</small>

Very low barrier to documentation of code with roxygen2
========================================================

Need a document formatting language
========================================================

<img src="figures/markdown.png" alt="alt text" width="400">

Markdown: lightweight, human-readable document formatting syntax
based on email text formatting

***

R Markdown: 
- minor extensions to allow R code display and execution
- embed images in html files (convenient for sharing)
- equations

One package to rule them all
========================================================
knitr - descendant of Sweave

<img src="figures/knitr.png" alt="alt text" width="400">


***

- 'dynamic documents' put narrative and code in the same location
- When data or narrative are updated, the document is automatically updated
- Data treated as 'read only'
- Output treated as disposable


Version control: Track changes for code
========================================================
Payoffs
- Eases collaboration
- Can track changes in any file type (plain text is best), and who made them
- Can revert file to any point in its tracked history

Costs
- Unfamiliar to most social scientists 
- Takes time to master

Environment for reproducible research
========================================================
RStudio is a free, open source, cross-platform integrated development environment for R

Has integrated R console, deep support for markdown and git

RStudio 'projects' make version control & document preparation trivial

The Hierarchy of Code Reproducibility 
========================================================
- Good: Use an integrated development environment (IDE). Keep your code in one place, let it do what its supposed to. (RStudio)
- Better: Use version control. Help yourself keep track of changes, fix bugs and improve project management (RStudio & Git & GitHub or BitBucket)
- Best: Use embedded code. Explicitly link code and text, save yourself time, save reviewers time, improve your code. (RStudio & Git & GitHub or BitBucket & R Markdown & knitr)


Use Pandoc to generate output from RStudio in many popular formats
========================================================
`

A universal document converter

Easily convert markdown file to many formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX, etc)

***

Depositing paper, code and data
========================================================
Payoffs
- Free space for hosting
- Assignment of persistent DOIs
- Tracking citation metrics (FigShare, ORCID)

Costs
- Sometimes license restrictions
- Limited or no private storage space

Ongoing problems
========================================================
- Reproducing big data and supercomputing research is hard
- Making sure that source code works on other people's computers
is hard (but not really our job - most licenses absolve us)
- Keeping detailed enough records is hard

Changing the culture and reward structure
========================================================
- Train students by making homework and assignments reproducible 
- Publish examples of reproducible research in our field
- Request code & data when reviewing
- Submit to and review for journals that support reproducible research
- Critically review and audit data management plans in grant proposals
- Consider reproducibility wherever possible in hiring, promotion, and reference letters.
