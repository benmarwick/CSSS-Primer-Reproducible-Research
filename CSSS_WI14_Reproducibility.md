Motivations
========================================================

>"An article about computational result is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code and data, that produced the result." <small>- Claerbout and Karrenbach, Proceedings of the 62nd Annual International Meeting of the Society of Exploration Geophysics. 1992</small>

>"When we publish articles containing figures which were generated by computer, we also publish the complete software environment which generates the figures" <small>- Buckheit & Donoho, Wavelab and Reproducible Research, 1995.</small>


Yields & Restrictions
=======================================================
- Verification: easier to find and fix bugs
- Transparency: leads increased citation count, broader impact
- Efficiency: via de-duplication of effort

***

- Classified or sensitive data
- Nondisclosure agreements
- Software licensing issues


Spectrum of reproducibility
=======================================================

Research pipeline
=======================================================

<small>http://www.stodden.net/AMP2011/slides/pengslides.pdf</small>

Click trails are ephemeral 
========================================================
- GUIs and copy-paste are bad for reproducibility 
- A lot of manual & ad hoc data handling
- Leaves no trace
- Difficult to document
- Difficult to remember

Scripted analyses endure
========================================================

***

Plain text files and UTF-8 encoding will be readable for a long time

They are much more accessible

Literate statistical programming 
========================================================
>"Instead of imagining that our main task is to instruct a computer what to do, let us concentrate rather on explaining to humans what we want the computer to do."-- Donald E. Knuth, Literate Programming, 1984

***

For example...
Let's calculate the current time in R.

```r
time <- format(Sys.time(), "%a %b %d %X %Y")
```

The text and R code are interwoven in the output:

The time is `` `r time` ``

The time is Fri Feb 14 1:12:31 PM 2014

Advantages and disadvantages
========================================================
Advantages of switching to literate programming
- Text and code all in one place, in logical order
- Data, results automatically updated to reflect external changes
- Automatic test when building document

Some disadvantages
- Text and code all in one place; can be hard to read sometimes, especially if there is a lot of code
- Can substantially slow down the processing of documents
(although caching can help)

Need a programming language
========================================================
Machine-readable

R: Free, open source, cross-platform, huge user community

R packages: the ideal 'Compendium'

>both a container for the different elements that make up the document and its computations (i.e. text, code, data, etc.), and as a means for distributing, managing and updating the collection... allow us to move from an era of advertisement to one where our scholarship itself is published <small>- Gentleman and Temple Lang 2004</small>

========================================================
Very low barrier to documentation of code with roxygen2

Need a document formatting language
========================================================
Human-readable

Markdown

R Markdown

***

One package to rule them all
========================================================
knitr - descendant of Sweave

![alt text](figures/knitr.png)

***

'dynamic documents' put narrative and code in the same location

When data or narrative are updated, the document is automatically updated


Version control
========================================================
>Payoffs

- Eases collaboration
- Can track changes in any file type, and who made them
- Can revert file to any point in its tracked history

>Costs

- 2-3 days to learn
- Takes a long time to master

Environment for reproducible research
========================================================
RStudio has integrated R console, support for markdown and git

RStudio 'projects' make version control trivial

Interactive charts in the browser with the rCharts package
========================================================

Interactive charts in the browser with brief code
========================================================
```
require(rCharts)
n1 <- nPlot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars, type = 'scatterChart')
n1$addParams(width = 600, height = 300)
n1
```
```
require(rCharts)
hair_eye_male <- subset(as.data.frame(HairEyeColor), Sex == "Male")
n2 <- nPlot(Freq ~ Hair, group = "Eye", data = hair_eye_male, type = "multiBarChart")
n2$addParams(width = 600, height = 300)
n2
```

The Hierarchy of Code Reproducibility
========================================================
- Good: Use an integrated development environment (IDE). Keep your code in one place, let it do what its supposed to. (RStudio)
- Better: Use version control. Help yourself keep track of changes, fix bugs and improve project management (Git & GitHub or BitBucket)
- Best: Use embedded code. Explicitly link code and text, save yourself time, save reviewers time, improve your code. (R Markdown & knitr)


Releasing output into the wild
========================================================
pandoc

A universal document converter

Easily convert markdown file to many formats (HTML, PDF, DOCX, etc)

***

Depositing Paper, code and data
========================================================
>Payoffs

- Free space for hosting
- Assignment of persistent DOIs
- Tracking citation metrics (FigShare, ORCID)

>Costs

- Sometimes license restrictions
- Limited or no private storage space

Ongoing problems
========================================================
- Reproducing big data and supercomputing research is hard
- Making sure that source code works on other people's computers
is hard
- Keeping detailed enough records is hard

Changing the culture and reward structure
